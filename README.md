Security Risk Assessment: Network Hardening for Social Media Organization
Overview
This README outlines the security risk assessment for a social media organization that recently experienced a significant data breach. The breach compromised sensitive customer information, including names and addresses. The organization aims to implement robust network hardening practices to prevent future attacks and breaches. This document details the identified vulnerabilities, the associated risks, and recommended methods to enhance network security.

Incident Summary
Following the data breach incident, a comprehensive inspection of the organization’s network revealed four critical vulnerabilities that require immediate attention:

Identified Vulnerabilities
Shared Passwords Among Employees

Employees are sharing passwords for accessing organizational systems, which increases the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
Default Admin Password for Database

The database admin password is set to a default value, making it an easy target for attackers exploiting common password vulnerabilities.
Insufficient Firewall Rules

The organization's firewalls lack properly configured rules to filter incoming and outgoing traffic, exposing the network to potential threats and unauthorized access.
Absence of Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

The organization does not implement MFA for user accounts, which diminishes the security of user logins and increases the risk of account compromise.
Risk Analysis
If these vulnerabilities are not addressed promptly, the organization faces a high risk of:

Data Breaches: Sensitive customer information can be accessed and exploited by malicious actors, leading to loss of trust and potential legal ramifications.
Unauthorized Access: Shared passwords and default admin credentials can facilitate unauthorized access to critical systems and data.
Network Attacks: The lack of firewall rules can allow attackers to infiltrate the network and launch various attacks, including DDoS and malware deployment.
Account Compromise: The absence of MFA increases the likelihood of account takeovers, putting user data at further risk.
Recommended Network Hardening Practices
To mitigate the identified vulnerabilities and enhance the overall security posture of the organization, the following network hardening practices are recommended:

Implement Strong Password Policies

Enforce policies requiring unique and complex passwords for each employee account, discouraging password sharing.
Conduct regular password audits to ensure compliance with the policies.
Change Default Admin Passwords

Immediately change all default passwords for admin accounts, especially for critical systems like the database.
Encourage regular password changes and avoid predictable patterns.
Configure Firewall Rules

Establish strict firewall rules to filter both incoming and outgoing traffic based on specific criteria, such as IP addresses and protocols.
Regularly review and update firewall configurations to respond to evolving threats.
Enable Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

Implement MFA for all user accounts to provide an additional layer of security during the login process.
Educate employees on the importance of MFA and how to use it effectively.
Conduct Regular Security Training

Provide ongoing security awareness training for employees to help them recognize and respond to potential threats.
Emphasize the importance of strong security practices, including password management and phishing awareness.
Perform Regular Security Audits

Schedule periodic security audits to assess the organization’s security posture and identify any new vulnerabilities.
Utilize third-party assessments to gain an external perspective on security measures and practices.
Monitor Network Traffic

Implement network monitoring tools to detect unusual traffic patterns and potential breaches in real time.
Establish an incident response plan to quickly address any detected threats.
Conclusion
The recent data breach experienced by the social media organization underscores the urgent need for strong network hardening practices. By addressing the identified vulnerabilities—such as shared passwords, default admin credentials, insufficient firewall rules, and the lack of multifactor authentication—the organization can significantly reduce its risk of future attacks and data breaches.

Implementing the recommended security measures will help protect customer information, maintain user trust, and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
